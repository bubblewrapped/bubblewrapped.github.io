A tiny selection of websites I worked on while working at Uglii from 2010 to 2016. The first was an informative site about the system the company was creating, a system similar to Google's nearby search in the maps site/app, except initially created years earlier. It was initially created using Drupal with a very different design before being redesigned in WordPress.

The second site was about the company itself and included information for shareholders as well as the ability to trade shares amongst themselves.

The third site was for one of a group of national partners who were tasked with getting businesses signed up with the service. This site was created in a short amount of time modifying an existing design already created for the site.

Unfortunately I didn't take anymore screenshots of the work I did before I left and the company went under. The first work I did for the company was the creation of a form to calculate returns a telecommunications company could expect if they signed up for the business search service. I didn't make the calculations themselves but I did create the form and code to send the input from the form to the spreadsheet with the calculations to a Word document using a web service that allows you to insert data using merge fields. That document was then converted using a web service to a pdf and that pdf could be downloaded straight from the page itself, and was sent to the user in
