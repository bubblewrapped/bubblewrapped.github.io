I decided I would try out Jykell and use GitHub pages to host it seeing as how it is provided for free. I've never been very good at keeping up a blog or writing very much for anything, it was something I was pulled up on at school. I'm going to include portfolio pieces in amongst the blog posts and have them be seperated in their own categories.

I will improve the look of the site as I go since this is still pretty rough and not even responsive yet. I just wanted to get something up and available on the internet so I can get my mind off it and onto other personal projects I want to work on.

It's been interesting to play around with Jekyll and it should be interesting to play with other web technologies for my other projects.
